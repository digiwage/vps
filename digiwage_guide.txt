Digiwage quick guide (compiled by Daniel_M from Discord)
On the VPS:
If you want to run more than 1 MN: * MAKE SURE YOUR VPS INSTANCE HAS IPv6 ENABLED * 
Login to your VPS instance as root and run: git clone https://github.com/damiensgit/vps.git && cd vps

For ONE MN run: ./install.sh -p digiwage
For say, 2 MN, run: ./install.sh -p digiwage -c 5

The digiwage source build should happen. It could take 15minutes so be patient
When the build is done and the script finishes, check the console output and make sure there are no errors.

On the Wallet:
Follow this guide:https://github.com/digiwage/digiwage_install/blob/master/digiwage_guide.txt
Additions to this guide
Generate multiple Genkeys for the number of MN's you intend to run
When adding genkey, txid and id number to your masternode.conf file the guide says to add IP address:46003. This is wrong. Obtain IPV6 addres from VPS by running ifconfig from console
for 2 MN's grab 2 IPV6 address from the ifconfig command and add those to your conf file surrounded by [] ([IPV6 ADDRESS]:port)
for example:
MN1  [2001:19f0:5:1993:2013::2]:46003 your_genkey_goes_here your_tx_id_goes_here index_id_num_here
MN2 [2001:19f0:5:1199:2013::1]:46003 your_genkey_goes_here your_tx_id_goes_here index_id_num_here

On the VPS:
Edit the number of conf files to the number of MN's you are creating. Below Im editing for 2 MN's on this VPS
run nano /etc/masternodes/digiwage_n1.conf and place your first genkey after masternodeprivkey= as shown
run nano /etc/masternodes/digiwage_n2.conf and place your second genkey after masternodeprivkey= as shown

Now you can activate the digiwage masternode(s) by running: /usr/local/bin/activate_masternodes_digiwage
9 - This will install the daemons as ubuntu services so you can stop/restart them easily any time.

Stop and start your MN's by running the following command for the number of MN's you are configuring. IN this example I'm doing 2 MN'say
systemctl restart digiwage_n1
systemctl restart digiwage_n2

Now check the status of your MN's (can be done anytime) by running the following command. Again in this example it will be run twice for MN1 and MN2
/usr/local/bin/digiwage-cli -conf=/etc/masternodes/digiwage_n1.conf masternode status
/usr/local/bin/digiwage-cli -conf=/etc/masternodes/digiwage_n2.conf masternode status

You should see that the nodes are waiting for remote start.

On the Wallet:
Open the debug console and start your MN'say
startmasternode alias false MN1
startmasternode alias false MN2

You should have success

Tips: 
The wallet and data are stored in /var/lib/masternodes/digiwageN/ where n is the masternode number (1,2, 3...). You will also find debug.log here.
On the vultr 1GB 5USD instance you should be able to easily run 5 masternodes. I use the top command to monitor CPU/mem usage over time.(edited)
